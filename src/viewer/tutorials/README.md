# Introduction

Here you will find tutorials that cover the main features of the viewer. Step by step, you will build a complete viewer example by adding a feature at a time.

## How to start

The code examples on the following tutorials can be used in different way. You just need to install the viewer and add a canvas with an `id` named `"viewerId"`.

The simplest way is to start with this code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>BIMDataViewer - Tutorials</title>
    <script src="https://www.unpkg.com/@bimdata/viewer@1.1.0"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div style="height: 100vh">
      <div id="viewerId"></div>
    </div>

    <script>

      /******* INSERT COMPLET CODE EXAMPLES HERE *******/

    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

And past the `Complet code example` sections you will find on the tutorials in an `index.html` file and open it in a compatible browser.

## Tutorials list

::: tip
It is a good idea to do tutorials in order as code is added to the same file step by step.
:::

- [Make your own window layout.](/viewer/tutorials/make_your_own_window_layout.html)
- [Add plugins on windows.](/viewer/tutorials/add_plugins_on_windows.html)
- [Create shortcuts.](/viewer/tutorials/shortcuts.html)
- [Create context menu command](/viewer/tutorials/context_menu.html)
- [Listen and update state](/viewer/tutorials/state.html)
- [Hubs](/viewer/tutorials/hubs.html)

## What do I do next?

Once finished, you will have solid knowledge of the main viewer features. The next sections [Customize the UI](/viewer/customize_the_ui.html) and [Develop your plugins](/viewer/plugins/overview.html) covers the respective features in depth and are the logic sequel of these tutorials. You will find features you already saw here with more detailed informations.
