# Projects

A project is a place where IFC files and documents are stored. IFC files and documents can be uploaded and organized, checkplans are defined. A project is attached to a cloud and a cloud can host an infinite number of projects.

A project contains:

- Models
- Document Management System
- BCFs

::: tip Note
A BCF is linked to a Project, not a Model.

A project member can see all other members, and an admin member can add a user to the project.
